                <p>Not only adults and teenagers can practice martial arts. Children can acquire priceless skills that will last a lifetime starting as early as age three. Martial arts like Taekwondo, which promote self-control and respect as well as physical fitness, self-assurance, and teamwork, can help mold and develop a child's character from an early age.</p>

                <p>Children, teenagers, and adults can learn the disciplined art of Taekwondo from OX Taekwondo. The Beginners class, which is intended for boys and girls starting with the age of five, is one of our most popular offerings.</p>

        <div class="card">
        <h2>ENCOURAGES FITNESS</h2>
        <p>IT'S A FACT THAT CHILDREN OF TODAY ARE LESS LIKELY TO GET UP AND MOVE AROUND AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO CLING TO THEIR SMARTPHONES OR IPADS. THE IDEA OF "PLAYING OUTSIDE" HAS ACTUALLY BEEN GREATLY DIMINISHED. THANKFULLY, MARTIAL ARTS IS A FANTASTIC METHOD TO INSTILL IN YOUR CHILD THE VALUE OF PHYSICAL FITNESS AND EXERCISE. MARTIAL ARTS, LIKE TAEKWONDO, PROVIDE YOUR KIDS AN ENJOYABLE EXERCISE THAT MAKES THEM FEEL FITTER, MORE ENERGISED, AND MORE LIKELY TO FORM HEALTHY HABITS.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
        <h2>BOOSTS SELF CONFIDENCE</h2>
        <p>WHILE MOST PEOPLE DON'T NATURALLY POSSESS SELF-CONFIDENCE, IT CAN BE DEVELOPED OVER TIME, PARTICULARLY IN CHILDHOOD. LEARNING A MARTIAL ART INVOLVES ACHIEVING NEW OBJECTIVES, WHICH BOOSTS CONFIDENCE WHEN IT'S DESPERATELY NEEDED. YOUR CHILD CAN DEVELOP DISCIPLINE AND SELF-CONFIDENCE FROM TAEKWONDO THAT WILL BENEFIT THEM IN ALL FACETS OF THEIR LIVES.</p>
